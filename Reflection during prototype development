## What I Learned

Throughout this module, I discovered that **iteration is not failure , it’s progress**.  
Every test, adjustment, and unexpected error revealed new information about how connected systems behave in real-world conditions.  
The process of making, breaking, and remaking became as valuable as the final working prototype.

### Key Insights

- **Iteration is learning in motion.**  
  Each version of my prototype , from initial sketches to final knock-detection logic — represented a step forward in understanding both hardware and design thinking.

- **Sensors behave differently in different environments.**  
  Calibration, environmental noise, and signal delay all affect reliability. I learned that a system that works in one setting may fail in another, and that this variability must be anticipated in design.

- **Simplicity and clarity are key.**  
  In connected environment design, clarity of interaction matters more than complexity. A clean, predictable response builds trust between user and system.

## Reflection

This project taught me to value the **process of iteration over the pursuit of perfection**.  
I learned that progress often comes from simplifying, removing unnecessary complexity, refining feedback loops, and focusing on how users experience the system, not just how it functions technically.

### Core Takeaways

- **Feedback drives evolution.**  
  By presenting prototypes early and receiving tutor and peer feedback, I learned how small adjustments could create major improvements in usability and stability.

- **Simplification leads to progress.**  
  Reducing code layers, cleaning the logic, and focusing on a single reliable input (the “three-knock” sequence) made my system more dependable and easier to explain.

- **Data represents experience.**  
  I began to see data not just as numbers or signals, but as a *translation of human interaction* , a way to make invisible processes visible through responsive design.

- **Change is part of creativity.**  
  Even though I shifted direction mid-project, from motion detection to sound-based input, each iteration revealed new understanding of how connected systems *sense, process, and respond*.

## Broader Understanding

Working on this IoT project deepened my appreciation of how **connected environments** merge technical precision with human experience.  
Every connected object is part of a larger dialogue, between people, devices, data, and space.  
Through this course, I learned not only to build prototypes but to **think critically about their purpose, context, and impact**.
